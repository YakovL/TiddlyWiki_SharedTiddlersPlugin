This plugin allows to use tiddlers in [TiddlyWiki 2.x](https://classic.tiddlywiki.com) from other TiddlyWikis (with or without importing them).
For instance, if you have several TWs, you can put common styles in one of them and share between others.
Likewise, you can write content and reuse it in other TWs.
You can explore more features in [docs](https://yakovl.github.io/TiddlyWiki_SharedTiddlersPlugin/#SharedTiddlersPluginInfo).

This plugin, like many others, are available to install via [ExtensionsExplorerPlugin](https://github.com/YakovL/TiddlyWiki_ExtensionsExplorerPlugin) (to find it, install the central collection and YLExtensionsCollection from it).
